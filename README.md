## Using this plugin

1. You need a Nibe heat pump - bye one if you don't have ;-)
2. You need an account at Nibe Uplink: https://www.nibeuplink.com/
3. After logging in you have an URL in this form: `https://www.nibeuplink.com/System/XXXXX/Status/Overview`
4. Instead of XXXXX there is a number. This is your System ID. We need this ID.
5. Go to Nibe Uplink Api: https://api.nibeuplink.com/Account/LogIn and log in
6. Click "MY APPLICATIONS" and then "Create application"
7. Fill in: Name and Description can be everything e.g. Homebridge
8. The Callback URL is important. You can use https://hp-net.github.io/homebridge-nibe/nibe.html
9. Accept the NIBE Uplink API Services Agreement and click "Create application"
10. Then you get an Identifier and a Secret - we need them
11. Using data from previous steps generate link like: `https://api.nibeuplink.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=READSYSTEM WRITESYSTEM&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL&state=123`
15. Paste link in the browser and follow the instructions. At the end you get your auth code - we need it
12. Install this plugin in homebridge
17. Fill in parameters gathered in previous steps.
18. Choose your language.
19. Click Save and Close

If you (later) get a "400 bad request" error in the log, you must get a new Auth Code - so do numbers 13 until 15 and 18.

## Manage/Write Support

It seems you can only change the parameters listet on the following web page:

https://api.nibeuplink.com/docs/v1/Parameters (Settings section)

The parameter "hot_water_boost" is parameter ID 48132.

You can read other values but I think you can't write other values. Other values are here listed:
